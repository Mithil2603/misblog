                                <li>In Linux, viruses and worms are found very rarely. In fact total number of viruses and worms found in Linux was less than 100. According to one report in 2003 this figure was 40.</li>
                                <li>According to Sophos Antivirus labs approximately 1000 new viruses are found every month. The Sophos antivirus product now guards against just under 100,000 viruses.</li>

                                    <li>Unix is a multiprogramming system, it permits multiple programs to run and compete for the attention of the CPU.</li>
                                    <li>It can happen in two ways:
                                        <ul className='mx-3'>
                                            <li>Multiple users can run separate jobs</li>
                                            <li>A single user can also run multiple jobs</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Windows is a single user system where CPU, Memory and hard disk are dedicated to a single user.</li>
                                    <li>In Unix the resources are shared between all users; Unix is a multiuser system.</li>
                                    <li>Computer divides a unit of time into several segments and each user is allocated a segment, so at a time machine will be doing the job of a single user only.</li>
                                    <li>Once the allocated time expires the previous job will be suspended and the next user's job will be taken.</li>
                                    <li>It will continue until the clock has turned full circle and the first user's job is taken again.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul className='mt-3'>
                                    <li>A single user can also run multiple tasks concurrently; Unix is a multitasking system.</li>
                                    <li>It is usual for a user to edit a file, print another one on printer, send email and browse the internet all without leaving any of the applications.</li>
                                    <li>The Kernel is designed to handle user's multiple needs.</li>
                                    <li>In a multitasking environment, a user sees one job running in the foreground and the rest run in the background. User can switch jobs between foreground, background , suspend or terminate them.</li>
                                    <li>It will continue until the clock has turned full circle and the first user's job is taken again.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul className='mt-3'>
                                    <li>The designers have never attempted to pack too many features into a few tools, instead developed a few hundred commands each of which performed one simple job only.</li>
                                    <li>Ex: ls | wc</li>
                                    <li>The above example will count the number of files and subdirectories in the current directory. No separate command is formed to perform this task.</li>
                                    <li> The commands that can be connected in this way re called filters because they filter or manipulate data in different ways.</li>
                                    <li>Today many Unix tools are designed with the requirement that the output of one tool can be used as input to another.</li>
                                    <li>By interconnecting a number of tools, user can have a large number of combinations of their usage.</li>

                                    <li> Unix represents the kernel but the kernel itself doesn't do much that can benefit the user.</li>
                                    <li>There are general-purpose tools, text manipulation utilities(called filters), compilers and interpreters, networked applications and system administration tools also.</li>
                                    <li>User can select one from variety of shells.</li>
                                    <li>New tools are being added and the older ones are being removed or modified with every Unix release.</li>
                                    <li>The open-source versions for most of the utilities are available.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Unix has very sophisticated pattern matching features.</li>
                                    <li>Ex: ls chap*</li>
                                    <li>The above example will list out all the filenames which are starting with “chap” word.</li>
                                    <li>Here the *(metacharacter) is a special character used by the system to indicate that it can match a number of filenames.</li>
                                    <li>Unix has also a special expression called a regular expression that is framed with characters from the set of metacharacters, which can perform complex pattern matching tasks also.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>The Unix shell is also a programming language which was designed for a programmer not for a casual end user.</li>
                                    <li>It has control structures, loops and variables which establishes it as a powerful programming language.</li>
                                    <li>These features are used to design shell scripts.</li>
                                    <li>Many of the system's functions can be controlled and automated by using shell scripts.</li>

                        <p className="text">
                            <ul>
                                <li>The commands that are directly executed by the shell are known as internal commands. No separate process is there to run these commands.</li>
                                <li>The commands that are executed by the kernel are knows as external commands. Each command has its unique process id.</li>
                                <li>Internal commands are the built in commands of the shell, which means that when you execute an internal command, no process will be launched to execute the command. Therefore the speed of executing an internal command will be very high. Example: cd,pwd,echo,etc.</li>
                                <li>Shell starts separate sub-process to execute external commands. Most external commands are stored in the form of binaries in /bin directory.</li>
                                <ul className='mx-3'>
                                    <li>To execute external command shell checks $PATH variable . If command is present in the location mentioned in $PATH variable shell will execute it , otherwise it will give an error. <b>Ex:</b> ls, mv, cat, etc.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>type utility can be used to check whether a command is internal or external.if the command is internal, the output will say that the command is shell builtin. If the command is external, the output will give you the path to the command.</li>
                                <li> The internals (a small number, especially compared to the rest of them) are the commands that are built in your shell.</li>
                                <li>External commands are the commands that your system offer, the ones that are totally shell-independent and usually can be found in any Linux distribution. They mostly reside in /bin and /usr/bin, and those locations must be part of your $PATH variable in order to be usable. Commands used mainly by the superusers/sysadmins are to be found in /sbin and /usr/sbin and usually require root privileges to run. So /sbin and /usr/sbin are in root's $PATH but not in a normal user's.</li>
