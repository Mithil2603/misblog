                                    <li> Unix represents the kernel but the kernel itself doesn't do much that can benefit the user.</li>
                                    <li>There are general-purpose tools, text manipulation utilities(called filters), compilers and interpreters, networked applications and system administration tools also.</li>
                                    <li>User can select one from variety of shells.</li>
                                    <li>New tools are being added and the older ones are being removed or modified with every Unix release.</li>
                                    <li>The open-source versions for most of the utilities are available.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h5 className='mt-4'><li>Pattern Matching</li></h5>
                                <ul className='mt-3'>
                                    <li>Unix has very sophisticated pattern matching features.</li>
                                    <li>Ex: ls chap*</li>
                                    <li>The above example will list out all the filenames which are starting with “chap” word.</li>
                                    <li>Here the *(metacharacter) is a special character used by the system to indicate that it can match a number of filenames.</li>
                                    <li>Unix has also a special expression called a regular expression that is framed with characters from the set of metacharacters, which can perform complex pattern matching tasks also.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h5 className='mt-4'><li>Programming Facility</li></h5>
                                <ul className='mt-3'>
                                    <li>The Unix shell is also a programming language which was designed for a programmer not for a casual end user.</li>
                                    <li>It has control structures, loops and variables which establishes it as a powerful programming language.</li>
                                    <li>These features are used to design shell scripts.</li>
                                    <li>Many of the system's functions can be controlled and automated by using shell scripts.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>The principal online help facility available is the man command, which remains the most important reference for commands and their configuration files.</li>
                                    <li>A vast ocean of Unix resources are available on the internet.</li>
                                    <li>There exists several newsgroups on Unix where an user can fire his/her query and can get solution from the newsgroup community members.</li>
                                    <li>The FAQ is a document that addresses common problems and is also widely available on the internet.</li>
                                    <li>There are numerous articles published in magazines and journals and lecture notes made available by universities on their websites.</li>
