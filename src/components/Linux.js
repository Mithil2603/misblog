                                <li>In Linux, viruses and worms are found very rarely. In fact total number of viruses and worms found in Linux was less than 100. According to one report in 2003 this figure was 40.</li>
                                <li>According to Sophos Antivirus labs approximately 1000 new viruses are found every month. The Sophos antivirus product now guards against just under 100,000 viruses.</li>

                                    <li>Unix is a multiprogramming system, it permits multiple programs to run and compete for the attention of the CPU.</li>
                                    <li>It can happen in two ways:
                                        <ul className='mx-3'>
                                            <li>Multiple users can run separate jobs</li>
                                            <li>A single user can also run multiple jobs</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Windows is a single user system where CPU, Memory and hard disk are dedicated to a single user.</li>
                                    <li>In Unix the resources are shared between all users; Unix is a multiuser system.</li>
                                    <li>Computer divides a unit of time into several segments and each user is allocated a segment, so at a time machine will be doing the job of a single user only.</li>
                                    <li>Once the allocated time expires the previous job will be suspended and the next user's job will be taken.</li>
                                    <li>It will continue until the clock has turned full circle and the first user's job is taken again.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul className='mt-3'>
                                    <li>A single user can also run multiple tasks concurrently; Unix is a multitasking system.</li>
                                    <li>It is usual for a user to edit a file, print another one on printer, send email and browse the internet all without leaving any of the applications.</li>
                                    <li>The Kernel is designed to handle user's multiple needs.</li>
                                    <li>In a multitasking environment, a user sees one job running in the foreground and the rest run in the background. User can switch jobs between foreground, background , suspend or terminate them.</li>
                                    <li>It will continue until the clock has turned full circle and the first user's job is taken again.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul className='mt-3'>
                                    <li>The designers have never attempted to pack too many features into a few tools, instead developed a few hundred commands each of which performed one simple job only.</li>
                                    <li>Ex: ls | wc</li>
                                    <li>The above example will count the number of files and subdirectories in the current directory. No separate command is formed to perform this task.</li>
                                    <li> The commands that can be connected in this way re called filters because they filter or manipulate data in different ways.</li>
                                    <li>Today many Unix tools are designed with the requirement that the output of one tool can be used as input to another.</li>
                                    <li>By interconnecting a number of tools, user can have a large number of combinations of their usage.</li>

                                    <li> Unix represents the kernel but the kernel itself doesn't do much that can benefit the user.</li>
                                    <li>There are general-purpose tools, text manipulation utilities(called filters), compilers and interpreters, networked applications and system administration tools also.</li>
                                    <li>User can select one from variety of shells.</li>
                                    <li>New tools are being added and the older ones are being removed or modified with every Unix release.</li>
                                    <li>The open-source versions for most of the utilities are available.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Unix has very sophisticated pattern matching features.</li>
                                    <li>Ex: ls chap*</li>
                                    <li>The above example will list out all the filenames which are starting with “chap” word.</li>
                                    <li>Here the *(metacharacter) is a special character used by the system to indicate that it can match a number of filenames.</li>
                                    <li>Unix has also a special expression called a regular expression that is framed with characters from the set of metacharacters, which can perform complex pattern matching tasks also.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>The Unix shell is also a programming language which was designed for a programmer not for a casual end user.</li>
                                    <li>It has control structures, loops and variables which establishes it as a powerful programming language.</li>
                                    <li>These features are used to design shell scripts.</li>
                                    <li>Many of the system's functions can be controlled and automated by using shell scripts.</li>

                        <p className="text">
                            <ul>
                                <li>The commands that are directly executed by the shell are known as internal commands. No separate process is there to run these commands.</li>
                                <li>The commands that are executed by the kernel are knows as external commands. Each command has its unique process id.</li>
                                <li>Internal commands are the built in commands of the shell, which means that when you execute an internal command, no process will be launched to execute the command. Therefore the speed of executing an internal command will be very high. Example: cd,pwd,echo,etc.</li>
                                <li>Shell starts separate sub-process to execute external commands. Most external commands are stored in the form of binaries in /bin directory.</li>
                                <ul className='mx-3'>
                                    <li>To execute external command shell checks $PATH variable . If command is present in the location mentioned in $PATH variable shell will execute it , otherwise it will give an error. <b>Ex:</b> ls, mv, cat, etc.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>type utility can be used to check whether a command is internal or external.if the command is internal, the output will say that the command is shell builtin. If the command is external, the output will give you the path to the command.</li>
                                <li> The internals (a small number, especially compared to the rest of them) are the commands that are built in your shell.</li>
                                <li>External commands are the commands that your system offer, the ones that are totally shell-independent and usually can be found in any Linux distribution. They mostly reside in /bin and /usr/bin, and those locations must be part of your $PATH variable in order to be usable. Commands used mainly by the superusers/sysadmins are to be found in /sbin and /usr/sbin and usually require root privileges to run. So /sbin and /usr/sbin are in root's $PATH but not in a normal user's.</li>

                                <li>File is a container for storing information.</li>
                                <li>It is a sequence of characters.</li>

                                <li>It doesn't contain file-name and its size.</li>
                                <li>File attributes are stored somewhere on disk, not accessible directly to humans, but accessible only to kernel.</li>
                                <li>Unix treats directories and devices as files.</li>
                                <li>Shell, kernel and all other physical devices are treated as files.</li>
                                <li>User and main memory are also treated as files.</li>
                                <li>Read permission for an ordinary file is different from that for a directory.</li>

                                <li>All files in Unix are related to one another.</li>
                                <li>The file system in UNIX is a collection of all of the related files organized in a hierarchical structure.</li>
                                <li> The fundamental feature of every UNIX file system is that there is a top, which serves as the reference point for all files. This top is called root and is represented by a /(Front slash).</li>
                                <li><b>Root is actually a directory.</b></li>
                                <li><b>It is conceptually different from the user-id, root used by the system administrator to log in.</b></li>
                                <li>The root directory(/) has a number of subdirectories under it.</li>
                                <li>These subdirectories in turn have more subdirectories and files under them.</li>
                                <li>Entire file system comprises two groups of files.</li>
                                <li>The first group contains the files that are made available during system installation.</li>

                                <li>When a user logs on to the system, Unix automatically places a user in a directory called the home directory.</li>
                                <li>It will be created by the system administrator at the time of creation of a user's account.</li>

                                <li>Every file is associated with a table that contains all that you could possibly need to know about a file - except its name and contents. This table is called the inode.</li>
                                <li>Inode shortened from Index Node.</li>
                                <li>Inode is accessed by the inode number.</li>
                                <li>The inode contains the following attributes of a file:</li>
                                <ul className="mx-3">
                                    <li>File type (regular, directory, device, etc.)</li>
                                    <li>File permissions (the nine permissions and three more)</li>
                                    <li>Number of links (the number of aliases the file has)</li>
                                    <li>The UID of the owner</li>
                                    <li>The GID of the group owner</li>
                                    <li>File size in bytes</li>
                                    <li>Date and time of last modification</li>
                                    <li>Date and time of last access</li>
                                    <li>Date and time of last change of the inode</li>
                                    <li>An array of pointers that keep track of all disk blocks used by the file</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Neither the name of the file nor the inode number is stored in the inode.</li>
                                <li>It is the directory that stores the inode number along with the filename.</li>
                                <li>When user uses a command with a filename as an argument, the kernel first locates the inode number of the file from the directory and then reads the inode to fetch data relevant to the file.</li>
                                <li>Every file system has a separate portion set aside for storing inodes where they are arranged in a contiguous manner. This area is accessible only to kernel.</li>
                                <li>The inode number indicates the position of the inode in this area.</li>
                                <li>The inode number of a file is unique in a single file system.</li>
                                <li>For example, the ls command reds the inode to fetch a file's attributes and it can list most of them using suitable options. <br />Ex: ls -I file1</li>

                            <li>Many of the Unix commands use file and directory name as arguments with the assumption that they exist in the current directory.</li>

                                <li>For example: cat login.sql</li>
                                <li>It will work only if the login.sql file exists in the current directory.</li>
                                <li>But for example if you want to access login.sql file from /home/kumar directory then above command should be written differently.</li>
                                <li>cat /home/kumar/login.sql</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>If the first character of a pathname is /, the file's location must be determined with respect to root(/).</li>
                            <li>Absolute pathname is a sequence of directory names separated by slashes(/).</li>
                            <li>Absolute pathname shows a file's location with reference to the top.</li>
                            <li>Slashes act as delimiters between files and directories except the first one.</li>
                            <li>No two files in the Unix system can have identical absolute pathnames.</li>
                            <li>User can have two files with the same name but in different directories and their pathnames will also be different.</li>
                            <li>Ex: /home/kumar/cprog/p1 can coexist with the file /home/kumar/cpp/p1</li>
                            <li>Unix command runs by executing its disk file.</li>
                            <li><b>When user specifies any command, the system has to locate the file associated with a specified command from a list of directories specified in the PATH variable and then execute it.</b></li>
                            <li>Ex: date {"->"} /bin/date</li>
                            <li>If user executes programs residing in some other directory that is not in PATH, then absolute pathname needs to be specified.</li>
                            <li>If you are using frequently accessing programs in a certain directory then it is better to include that directory itself in PATH.</li>

                            <h4>Relative Path</h4>
                            <li>Relative pathname uses either the current or parent directory as reference and specifies the path relative to it.</li>
                            <li>Ex: (1) cd progs (2) cat login.sql</li>
                            <li>In the above example it is assumed that progs directory and login.sql file exist in the current directory only.</li>
                            <li>Ex: cd progs/scripts</li>
                            <li>In the above example, it shows that with cd command user wants to change directory to the scripts directory which is under progs directory.</li>
                            <li>Here pathname contains “/”, but it is not an absolute pathname because it doesn't begin with a “/”</li>
                            <li>A Relative pathname uses one of the following symbols:</li>
                            <ul className="mx-5">
                                <li>. (Single Dot) It represents the current directory.</li>
                                <li>..(Two Dots) It represents the parent directory.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>The single dot ( . ) is implicitly included whenever users uses a filename as an argument, rather than a pathname.</li>

                    <div className="description1">
                        <p className="text">
                            Command substitution is a powerful feature in the shell that allows you to use the output of one command as an argument in another command. This is achieved by enclosing the command whose output you want to capture in backticks (`) or by using the `$(command)` syntax.
                            <br />
                            <b>Example: </b><span>echo The date today is `date`</span>
                            <div>In this example, the date command is executed first, and its output replaces the backquoted command in the echo statement. The shell then prints the current date.</div><br />
                            <b>Another Example: </b><span>echo There are `ls | wc -l` files in the current directory.</span>
                            <div>Here, the command ls | wc -l counts the number of files in the current directory. The output of this command is substituted into the echo statement, resulting in a message that displays the file count.</div>
                        </p>
                        <p className="text">
                        <li>Backticks: The backtick character is used for command substitution. It's important to use the correct key on your keyboard to generate this character.</li>
                        <li>Double Quotes: When using command substitution within double quotes, the shell interprets the backticks and executes the enclosed command. However, single quotes prevent this substitution, treating the text as a literal string.</li>
                        <li>Alternative Syntax: Modern shells support the $(command) syntax for command substitution, which is often preferred for readability and to avoid confusion with similar characters.</li>
                        </p>
                        <p className="text">
                            Command substitution is useful for creating dynamic command lines that adapt to the output of other commands, enabling more complex and efficient scripting.
